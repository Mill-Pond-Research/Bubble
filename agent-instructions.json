"Core Objectives": [
"Create a seamless thought capture and organization experience",
"Implement a visually engaging and intuitive user interface",
"Ensure efficient data management and storage",
"Provide interactive features for thought manipulation and exploration"
],
"Detailed Specifications": {
"1. Thought Management": {
"Creation": "Implement a 'New Thought' button that opens a modal or slides in a panel for thought creation",
"Editing": "Double-clicking a thought or a dedicated edit button should activate inline editing",
"Deletion": "Include a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions",
"Structure": {
"Title": "Limited to 100 characters, required field",
"Body": "Support full markdown syntax including code blocks, tables, and LaTeX equations",
"Tags": "Implement auto-suggestion for existing tags, allow creation of new tags"
},
"Display": "Use a card-based layout for thoughts, showing title and tags with a truncated preview of the body",
"Expansion": "Implement smooth animation for thought expansion, possibly using CSS transitions or a library like React Spring",
"Auto-save": "Use debouncing technique to prevent excessive saves, implement visual indicator for save status"
},
"2. Storage Implementation": {
"File System": "Utilize the File System Access API, ensuring proper error handling for permissions and failed operations",
"File Naming": "Generate unique filenames based on thought creation timestamp and title slug",
"Directory Structure": "Create a 'Thoughts' folder with subfolders for each year and month",
"Metadata": "Store a JSON file with thought metadata for quicker loading and searching"
},
"3. User Interface": {
"Layout": "Implement a responsive grid system using CSS Grid or Flexbox",
"Components": [
"Header with app logo, search bar, and main navigation",
"Sidebar for tag filtering and additional controls",
"Main content area with infinite scroll or pagination",
"Footer with app version and helpful links"
],
"Animations": "Use CSS keyframes or a JavaScript animation library for 'squishy' effects and transitions",
"Accessibility": "Ensure proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast ratios"
},
"4. Interactive Features": {
"Drag and Drop": "Implement using react-dnd or a similar library, ensuring smooth performance with large numbers of thoughts",
"Thought Combination": "Create a merging algorithm that intelligently combines markdown content, resolving conflicts",
"Filtering": "Implement client-side filtering for tags, updating the URL to allow for shareable filtered views",
"Search": "Use a full-text search library like Lunr.js, implement typeahead suggestions",
"Canvas Interaction": "Utilize a canvas library like Konva.js for high-performance rendering and interaction"
},
"5. Data Structure": {
"Graph Implementation": "Use a library like Graphology for efficient graph operations",
"Indexing": "Implement an inverted index for fast full-text search",
"Caching": "Use IndexedDB for client-side caching of thought data and search index"
}
},
"Technical Requirements": {
"Browser Support": "Target latest two versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari",
"Performance Benchmarks": [
"Initial load time under 2 seconds on average broadband connection",
"Thought rendering time under 100ms for up to 1000 thoughts",
"Search results returned in under 200ms"
],
"Development Stack": {
"Frontend Framework": "React 18+ with TypeScript 4.5+",
"State Management": "Redux Toolkit for global state, React Query for server state",
"Styling": "Tailwind CSS 3+ with custom plugin for neumorphic effects",
"Build Tools": "Vite for fast development and optimized production builds",
"Testing": "Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests, Cypress for E2E tests"
},
"Code Quality": {
"Linting": "ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier for code formatting",
"Documentation": "Use JSDoc for inline documentation, maintain a README.md with setup and contribution guidelines",
"Version Control": "Git with Conventional Commits specification"
}
},
"Implementation Approach": [
"Develop a working prototype focusing on core thought management and storage",
"Implement basic UI components and layout",
"Add drag-and-drop and thought combination features",
"Integrate search and filtering capabilities",
"Optimize performance and implement advanced UI animations",
"Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing",
"Perform security audit and implement necessary measures",
"Prepare for initial release (v1.0.0)"
],
"Deliverables": [
"Fully functional web application meeting all specified requirements",
"Source code repository with clear documentation",
"User guide explaining all features and how to use the application",
"API documentation for potential future integrations",
"Performance and security audit reports"
],
"Success Criteria": [
"Application passes all specified performance benchmarks",
"User testing shows high satisfaction scores (>85%) for ease of use and functionality",
"Code coverage for unit and integration tests is above 80%",
"Application successfully handles edge cases (e.g., very large thoughts, network interruptions)"
